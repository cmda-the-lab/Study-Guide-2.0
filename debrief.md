# Study Guide 2.0

## MVP (what it must be)

### Problem

There is no overview of competencies per course in our curriculum.

### Project

This project provides an overview of competencies in our curriculum for the CMD exam committee.

A visualisation of all weighted competencies in each course per year, showing under- and overrepresentation of competencies.
For example, this tool would allow the exam committee to view missing competencies in our curriculum.
This could allow a proposed change to a course in its competencies to be more easily reviewed and judged.
An initial data model is a big list of all competencies through all our courses, per course, weighted from 0-5.

## Our VP (what it should be)

One central system housing info on our courses, in essence what studiegids contains now, but up to date.

This info should answer, about courses, for example:

*   Coordinators and teachers
*   Materials
*   Preconditions and potential followup courses
*   Communication
*   Assessment and grading
*   Learning goals
*   How many ECTS or hours are required
*   Types of work forms (lecture, lab, coaching, etc)
*   Effort (how intense)
*   Examples of student from previous years?

Even though, for studiegids, we need a static deployment of a subset of this info roughly a year before the course starts, some details are subject to change as the course draws closer.

This platform should allow these details to be added later, by teachers, which would provide an up-to-date overview of courses for students that currently are not served by studiegids.

It allows teachers to update info about their courses in one place.
The platform can be linked to from Moodle, GitHub, or other learning platforms.
Students could track (through notifications) updates to their courses.
Exam committee members could track changes to competencies.

By housing the info in one central system, it is possible to link to other (parts of) courses, such as, for a student to see the material used in a previous course, to reactive already acquired knowledge and skills.

## Stakeholders

*   Students (view info)
*   Coordinators (fill in core info)
*   Teachers (edit info)
*   ExCom (review info)
*   Lab (research work)
*   Lab workers (hone skills, learn as junior dev/des)
