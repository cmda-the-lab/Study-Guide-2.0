# Data Model

This folder contains all the info on the conceptual data model of the Study Guide project The Lab.

[`index.ts`](index.ts) contains typescript definitions for the conceptual model, and all the interfaces used throughout the API.

Note that this model intentionally does not deal with:

*   Universities ‚Äî for now, there‚Äôs just AUAS / HVA

Additionally, the following structures are limited:

*   People ‚Äî for now, people are one big list, the model does not deal with people starting or ending work, or people working at multiple faculties
*   Years ‚Äî for now, competencies and courses exist, but they do not exist or change across years.
    New or changed ones get new identifiers

The other directories contain a potential API structure, and examples of data as could be exposed from said API, implementing the typescript definitions.

## Table of Contents

## Nodes

The following interfaces are exposed directly through the API.

### Faculty

A faculty is a group of programs in a university.

```typescript
export interface Faculty {
  id: string
  name: I18NLiteral[]
  programs?: Program[]
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier to distinguish one faculty from another across a university.

The `name` field is list of [I18NLiteral][]s.

Conceptually, there could be a `programs` field containing a list of [Program][]s exposed as well.

For example, a faculty could look like:

```json
{
  "id": "fdmci",
  "name": [
    {"language": "nl", "value": "Digitale Media en Creatieve Industrie"},
    {"language": "en", "value": "Digital Media and Creative Industry"}
  ]
}
```

### Program

A program is a group of courses required and elective, resulting in some piece of paper meaning a set of competencies have been attained.

```typescript
export interface Program {
  id: string
  name: I18NLiteral
  courses?: Course[]
  competencies?: Competencies[]
  faculty?: Faculty
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier to distinguish one program from another across a university.

The `name` field is list of [I18NLiteral][]s.

Conceptually, there could be a `courses` field containing a list of [Course][]s exposed as well.

Conceptually, there could be a `competencies` field containing a list of [Competencies][]s exposed as well.

Conceptually, there could be a `faculty` field containing a [Faculty][] exposed as well.

For example, a program could look like:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-vt",
  "name": [
    {"language": "nl", "Communicatie en Multimedia Design"},
    {"language": "en", "Communcation and Multimedia Design"}
  ]
}
```

### Person

A person represents a human.
For now humans are simple, but they could be in some form of VCard / HCard in the future:

```typescript
export interface Person {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier to distinguish one person from another across a university.

The `name` field is name of a human, typically a given name and a family name.

The `email` field is a work email address to contact the person.

For example, a person could look like:

```json
{
  "id": "wormt",
  "name": "Titus Wormer",
  "email": "t.e.wormer@hva.nl"
}
```

### Competency

A competency represents a thing humans could attain.
For now, we‚Äôre only dealing with competencies as if they have always existed, will always exist, and will never change.

```typescript
export interface Competency {
  id: string
  name: I18NLiteral[]
  description: I18NRoot[]

  indicators?: Indicator[]
  program?: Program
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier to distinguish one competency from another across a program.

The `name` field is a list of [I18NLiteral][]s.

The `description` field is a list of [I18NRoot][]s.

Conceptually, there could be a `indicators` field containing a list of [Indicator][]s exposed as well.

Conceptually, there could be a `program` field containing a [Program][] exposed as well.

For example, a competency could look like:

```js
{
  "id": "4",
  "name": [
    {"language": "nl", "value": "Evalueren"},
    {"language": "en", "value": "Evaluation"}
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "language": "nl",
      "content": {
        // ...
      }
    },
    {
      "language": "en",
      "content": {
        // ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Indicator

An indicator is something that proves part of a competency.

```typescript
export interface Indicator {
  id: string
  name: I18NLiteral[]
  description: I18NRoot[]

  indicators?: Indicator[]
  program?: Program
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier to distinguish one indicator from another across a program.

The `name` field is a list of [I18NLiteral][]s.

The `description` field is a list of [I18NRoot][]s.

Conceptually, there could be a `competency` field containing a [Competency][] that is proven by this indicator.

Conceptually, there could be a `program` field containing a [Program][] exposed as well.

For example, an indicator could look like:

```js
{
  "id": "4a",
  "name": [
    {"language": "nl", "value": "Een CMD‚Äôer is kritisch op het eigen werk met als doel dit te verbeteren en zoekt actief naar feedback."},
    {"language": "en", "value": "A CMD‚Äôer is self-critical to be able to improve their work and actively look for feedback."}
  ],
  "description": [
    {
      "language": "nl",
      "content": {
        // ...
      }
    },
    {
      "language": "en",
      "content": {
        // ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Abstract interfaces

The following interfaces are used in concrete interfaces (those exposed through the API directly).

### I18NLiteral

A translatable literal is a textual value.

```typescript
export interface I18NLiteral {
  language: string
  value: string
}
```

The `language` field is a BCP-47 tag, as relaxed as possible, defining the natural language `value` is in.

The `value` field is a string representing the interface.

For example, a literal could look like:

```js
{"language": "nl", "value": "Digitale Media en Creatieve Industrie"},
```

### I18NRoot

A translatable root is any longform value.

```typescript
export interface I18NRoot {
  language: string
  content: HASTNode[]
}
```

The `language` field is a BCP-47 tag, as relaxed as possible, defining the natural language `content` is in.

The `content` field is a list of [HASTNode][]s.

For example, a root could look like:

```js
{
  "language": "nl",
  "content": [{
    "type": "element",
    "tagName": "p",
    "properties": {},
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "üèï In Frontend Applications ("
      },
      {
        "type": "element",
        "tagName": "strong",
        "properties": {},
        "children": [{"type": "text", "value": "fa"}]
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "value": ") kijken we naar wat er nodig is om een frontend app te ontwikkelen. We combineren HTML en CSS kennis uit Frontend 1, JavaScript uit Frontend 2, en Node uit Backend.

      }
    ]
  }]
},
