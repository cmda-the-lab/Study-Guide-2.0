# Iteration 1 - Study Guide

This repo holds documentation for the first iteration of The Lab, an accelerator
where students work as juniors and teachers hone their skills at [**@cmda**][cmda].

## Synopsis

This iteration, the first of The Lab, is focussed on building an interactive
and better study guide (the static, out-of-date but official way to store and
find info on courses and programmes).

## Team

*   Roey Tsemah ([**@pitzzz**][pitzzz], teacher)
*   Laurens Aarnoudse ([**@Razpudding**][razpudding], teacher)
*   Titus Wormer ([**@wooorm**][wooorm], teacher)
*   Florence Hoogveld (student)

## Communication

We use:

*   [GitHub][gh] — for files, documentation, and planning
*   Slack — for private and irrelevant communication※
*   Drive — for private files and easy collaboration※
*   Status Hero — team status reports

> ※ ask any team member for an invite

## Calendar

This iteration runs throughout Quarter 1 (fall) of the school year 2018-2019,
as in, September 3 through December 20.

We meet in person every Tuesday morning.
Other than that, we co-work or meet as often as we can, and work remotely if
that’s not feasible.
