# Cycle 1 - Study Guide

This repo holds documentation for the first cycle of The Lab, an accelerator
where students work as juniors and teachers hone their skills at [**@cmda**][cmda].

## Synopsis

This cycle, the first of The Lab, is focussed on building an interactive
and better study guide (the static, out-of-date but official way to store and
find info on courses and programmes).

For more info on the initial idea, see [debrief.md][debrief].

To see how we worked, peruse [worklog.md][worklog].

## Calendar

This cycle runs throughout Quarter 1 (fall) of the school year 2018-2019,
